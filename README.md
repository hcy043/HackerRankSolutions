## 2-Counting Valleys
###### Problem Github link 
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/counting-valleys/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup

###### Description
Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. During his last hike he took exactly  steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill, , or a downhill,  step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a  unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through.

For example, if Gary's path is , he first enters a valley  units deep. Then he climbs out an up onto a mountain  units high. Finally, he returns to sea level and ends his hike.

Function Description

Complete the countingValleys function in the editor below. It must return an integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary traversed.

countingValleys has the following parameter(s):

n: the number of steps Gary takes
s: a string describing his path
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of steps in Gary's hike.
The second line contains a single string , of  characters that describe his path.

Constraints

Output Format

Print a single integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary walked through during his hike.

Sample Input

8

Sample Output

1
Explanation

If we represent _ as sea level, a step up as /, and a step down as \, Gary's hike can be drawn as:

_/\      _
   \    /
    \/\/
He enters and leaves one valley.
## 3-Jumping On The Clouds

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/jumping-on-the-clouds/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup
###### Description
Emma is playing a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds. Some of the clouds are thunderheads and others are cumulus. She can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equal to the number of the current cloud plus  or . She must avoid the thunderheads. Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take Emma to jump from her starting postion to the last cloud. It is always possible to win the game.

For each game, Emma will get an array of clouds numbered  if they are safe or  if they must be avoided. For example,  indexed from . The number on each cloud is its index in the list so she must avoid the clouds at indexes  and . She could follow the following two paths:  or . The first path takes  jumps while the second takes .

Function Description

Complete the jumpingOnClouds function in the editor below. It should return the minimum number of jumps required, as an integer.

jumpingOnClouds has the following parameter(s):

c: an array of binary integers
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the total number of clouds. The second line contains  space-separated binary integers describing clouds  where .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the minimum number of jumps needed to win the game.

## 4-Repeated String
###### Problem Github link 
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/repeated-string/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup
###### Description
Lilah has a string, , of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.

Given an integer, , find and print the number of letter a's in the first  letters of Lilah's infinite string.

For example, if the string  and , the substring we consider is , the first  characters of her infinite string. There are  occurrences of a in the substring.

Function Description

Complete the repeatedString function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of occurrences of a in the prefix of length  in the infinitely repeating string.

repeatedString has the following parameter(s):

s: a string to repeat
n: the number of characters to consider
Input Format

The first line contains a single string, .
The second line contains an integer, .

Constraints

For  of the test cases, .
Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the number of letter a's in the first  letters of the infinite string created by repeating  infinitely many times.

Sample Input 0

aba
10
Sample Output 0

7
Explanation 0
The first  letters of the infinite string are abaabaabaa. Because there are  a's, we print  on a new line.

Sample Input 1

a
1000000000000
Sample Output 1

1000000000000
Explanation 1
Because all of the first  letters of the infinite string are a, we print  on a new line.

###### Description

Harold is a kidnapper who wrote a ransom note, but now he is worried it will be traced back to him through his handwriting. He found a magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create an untraceable replica of his ransom note. The words in his note are case-sensitive and he must use only whole words available in the magazine. He cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.

Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print Yes if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print No.

For example, the note is "Attack at dawn". The magazine contains only "attack at dawn". The magazine has all the right words, but there's a case mismatch. The answer is .
